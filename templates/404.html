            Oh, the trials of debugging code,
            In ancient tongue, my heart doth bode.
            Errors lurk in every line,
            A weary task, this search divine.

            With patience and a steady hand,
            I seek to vanquish bugs so grand.
            For though they vex and cause much strife,
            My code shall work, with renewed life.

            So let us code, and debug well,
            For triumph awaits, so we can tell
            The tale of bugs, once fierce and dire,
            But now vanquished, with passion's fire.
