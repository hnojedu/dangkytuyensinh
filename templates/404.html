            Amidst the digital realm we tread
            A curious message we doth dread
            "Not Found", it doth boldly declare
            A page now lost, beyond repair
            
            A link now broken, a path unknown
            Our quest for answers, fruitless grown
            A digital mystery, we cannot solve
            Lost in the ether, never to evolve
            
            Oh, how we yearn to see it once more
            That page we cherished, now in store
            But alas, it seems forever lost
            A memory we must now count the cost
            
            So let us take heed of this fate
            And ensure our links never abate
            For in this world of cyber sound
            A "Not Found" can leave us forever bound.
