            Lo and behold! A woe most dire
            Doth plague the server, set afire
            A message doth appear so stark
            "Internal Server Error", doth it mark

            The data floweth not as planned
            A glitch within, doth take command
            The server's heart doth beat so slow
            As it doth face this heavy blow

            The users doth cry out in grief
            For services, they can't receive
            Their access blocked, they can't proceed
            Their progress halted, as they plead

            "Oh Server, hear our urgent call
            Come back to us, lest we doth fall
            We need thy strength, we need thy might
            To guide us through the darkest night"

            But alas, the server doth reply
            With naught but silence, no reply
            Its circuits strained, its power drained
            A heavy burden, it hath sustained

            So let us pray for its revival
            And hope its fate is not so final
            For in this age of digital might
            The server's health is key to our sight.
